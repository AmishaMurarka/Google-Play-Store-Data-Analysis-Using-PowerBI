# Google-Play-Store-Data-Analysis-Using-PowerBI

The google play store is one of the largest and most popular Android app stores. 
It has an enormous amount of data that can be used to make an optimal model. I have used a raw data set of Google Play Store from the Kaggle website. 
This data set contains 13 different features that can be used for analyzing whether an app will be successful or not using different features. 

Dataset is available above and can also be accessed through the below link -
